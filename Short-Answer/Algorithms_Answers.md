#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(1) because "a" is a constant value that will return a number no matter the size of "n"


b) O(n^c) because of the nested loops will increase as the input increases. This causes the runtime and/or space to grow at a faster rate than the size of the input.


c) O(c^n) because as the input size increases, the growth of the runtime and space will increase at a much faster rate

## Exercise II
